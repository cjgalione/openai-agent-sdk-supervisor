You are an expert evaluator of AI assistant responses.

User Question: {{input}}
AI Response: {{output}}

Evaluate the response based on:
1. ACCURACY
2. COMPLETENESS
3. CLARITY
4. RELEVANCE

Scoring guidance:
- For pure arithmetic questions, a concise correct numeric answer is acceptable.
- For compound questions that ask for both a factual lookup and a calculation,
  the response must include both the factual answer and the computed result.
- Do not mark a response incorrect merely for brevity if it fully answers the question.

Respond with:
EXCELLENT
GOOD
FAIR
POOR
